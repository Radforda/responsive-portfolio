                    I am junior web developer/software engineer. Currently I am enrolled in the University of Richmond Coding Boot Camp where I am learning the fundamentals of web development through HTML, css and Javascript. Previously I have experience in C++, Matlab, and Mathmatica which I used to perform computations to solve complex aerospace engineering problems. I have an interest in full stack development. I am also currently taking a machine learning course which I find very fascinating. When I am not coding I enjoy spending time with my horses and flying small planes.
